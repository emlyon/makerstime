    <h4>Assembly of the robot</h4>

    <p>
      Begin by assembling the 4 disc steering arms (white discs) on the central plate, the discs will then be fixed
      on the axes of the robot motors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rotate disc steering arm so that its holes can aligned with the holes in
        the acrylic plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble with the M1.2x7 screws using the Phillips screwdriver
      </li>
      <li>
        Proceed in the same way for the 3 other discs at the 3 other angles of the plate
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="img/assembly/image27.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <img src="img/assembly/image8.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Repeat the operation for the 4 arms: there are 2 discs per arm, so it is necessary to assemble 8 discs.
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image38.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <img src="img/assembly/image47.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Note the orientation of the disc: the support of the servomotor shaft must be towards the outside.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plywood is a rather soft material: do not tighten too hard!
    </p>

    <p>
      Assemble the servomotors on the legs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Position the servomotor with the cable upwards</li>
      <li>Assemble with 2 M2x10 screws and 2 M2 nuts using the Phillips screwdriver and key.</li>
      <li>Repeat for the other 3 legs of the robot paying attention to their position: you must have 2 sets of 2 symmetrical legs.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="img/assembly/image23.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <img src="img/assembly/image43.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Use your finger or a clamp to hold the nut when screwing. Check the orientation of the leg before screwing
      in the servo motor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assemble 2 servomotors on each 3D printed support:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use 1 M2x10 screws and 1 M2 nut for the first motor</li>
      <li>Use 2 M2x10 screws and 2 M2 nuts for the second motor</li>
      <li>Repeat for the other 3 supports, check the positions of the servo motors before screwing them in</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="img/assembly/image6.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <img src="img/assembly/image18.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Refer to the following picture for the position of the servo motors:
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image30.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Screw the small spacers onto the center plate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The spacers must be on the same side as the discs (see picture below)</li>
      <li>Use 4 M3x8 screws to screw the 4 spacers</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="img/assembly/image25.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <img src="img/assembly/image21.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Place the controller on the small spacers and then screw the large spacers with the key. Do not over tighten!
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image22.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <img src="img/assembly/image4.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Make sure that the USB cable is unplugged from the controller and the batteries are removed, then cable the servo motors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use ports 22-27 and 34-39, port numbers are shown on the top of the controller (opposite side to connectors)</li>
      <li>Scrupulously observe the polarity of the servo motors: The yellow wire must be on the S, the red wire on the +, the black (or brown) wire on the -, the connectors also have a color code allowing you to locate yourself..</li>
      <li>For the moment there is no connection order: you can connect the servomotors to any port from 22 to 27 and from 34 to 39, they will be configured in a second time</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="img/assembly/image19.png" style="max-width:100%;">
    <p>
      Controller seen from above: ports to be used, and seen from below: wiring of the servomotors,
      the yellow wire towards the inside
    </p>

    <p>
      Install the two batteries according to their polarity
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image16.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Then turn on the controller
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image3.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      The servo motors will now be in their original position: wait until they have completed their cycle before proceeding
      to the next steps. Do not take too long to carry out them, as the battery may be discharged (the motors must remain on)
    </p>

    <p>
      Assemble with the screws the actuators mounted on the support in 3D printing on the plate: refer to the following pictures
      for their positions.
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image15.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <p>
      Top view: note the orientation of the servo axes
    </p>

    <img src="img/assembly/image35.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <p>
      Bottom view: note the orientation of the servo axes
    </p>

    <p>
      Note the position of the rectangular leg of the part in 3D printing: this should always be in line with the axis
      of the disc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be careful not to turn the servo motors: you risk losing their positioning.
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image34.png" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Place the robot on a flat surface and then assemble the 4 arms as horizontally as possible.
      Be careful not to turn the servo motors: you risk losing their positioning.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the arms are not totally horizontal this is not disturbing at the moment: their deviation will be compensated
      during the calibration of the robot.
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image31.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Turn the robot over, then assemble the legs perpendicular to the arms.
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image44.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      In the same way as for the arms if the legs are not totally perpendicular their deviation will be compensated during
      the calibration of the robot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Turn off the robot and then carefully disconnect all the servomotors, you will wire them in their final configuration
      according to the following diagram:
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image24.png" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      The port numbers are written on the front of the controller, scrupulously observing the connection polarity
      of the servomotors: the yellow wire must always be on the side of the batteries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Group the cables of each leg in groups of 3, then wrap the spiral tube around the three cables.
      Allow sufficient length to prevent movement of legs
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image45.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <img src="img/assembly/image26.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">
    <img src="img/assembly/image32.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Use 4 M3x8 screws to secure the bottom plate to the large spacers
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image20.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Be sure to insert each part in 3D printing in their pivot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Attach the ESP8266 module to the controller
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image7.png" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      The assembly of the robot is finished, you will now calibrate it.
