        <h4>Adobe Illustrator</h4>
        <p>
            In this tutorial we will discuss the basics of vector drawing with Adobe Illustrator:
            you will be guided step by step to customize the components of your quadruped robot that you will then cut by laser.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adobe Illustrator is a vector drawing software that offers many illustrative functions.
            Unlike matrix images that consist of pixels aligned on a frame,
            the vector images generated by Illustrator consist of curves generated by mathematical formulas:
            they do not lose quality when enlarged. Illustrator is therefore also well suited
            to the creation of images for the paper or internet edition, as for the machining with numerical control:
            in our case the laser cutting.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image1_en.png">
        <caption>Vector images vs matrix images</caption>
        <p>
          Start Illustrator and open the file <em>"robots-laser.ai"</em> which contains the robot elements that will be
          laser cut:<br><em>Open -> fichier quadrup√®des</em>
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image5_en.png">
        <p>
            Be sure to record your work regularly as you progress through the tutorial:<br><em>File > Save</em> or [Ctrl]+[S]</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            First you will reset the workspace so that it corresponds to the one we are going to present to you,
            go to the menu (top bar) then click: <br><em>Window > workspace > reset the essentials</em>
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image11_en.png">
        <p>
            The Illustrator interface consists primarily of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>(1) a menu bar at the top</li>
            <li>(2) a control panel at the top, under the menu bar</li>
            <li>(3) a toolbar on the left</li>
            <li>(4) of one or more work plans at the center</li>
            <li>(5) of several tool panels on the right</li>
        </ul>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image16.jpg">
        <p>
            The various open documents are presented in the form of tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Illustrator supports a wide variety of file formats. In the same document,
            it is therefore possible to insert both images, text or plots.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Tip: If you want to know what an interface icon is, place your pointer on it and then wait,
            you will see a tooltip.</em>
        </p>

        <h5>RGB and CMYK colorimetric models</h5>
        <p>
            For laser cutting we use color codes corresponding to different types of tasks sent to the machine:
            for example, the fine contours in pure red correspond to cut-outs, flat black and gray levels to engravings etc.
            There are two ways to create colors: RGB mode and CMYK mode.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image12_en.png">
        <p>
            <strong>RGB mode </ strong> This mode is called "additive" because it allows the creation of colors by mixing red,
            green and blue. This mixture gives cyan, magenta, yellow and white. This technique is used when the color emanates
            from the light source, for example in screens and lighting.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image20_en.png">
        <p>
            <strong>CMYK mode </strong>: this mode is called "subtractive", in which case the color does not emanate
            from the light source, it is the white ambient light that reaches a colored medium.
            Part of the spectrum is absorbed by the support and the other is reflected towards the eye of the observer.
            The colors are obtained by associating pure cyan (C), magenta (M) and yellow (Y), the black (K) is added
            in order to deepen the blacks. This technique is called quadrichromy, it is widely used in printing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our case we will use the RGB mode: <br><em>File > document color mode > RGB mode</em>
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image22_en.png">

        <h5>Moving around in the document</h5>
        <p>
            We will now be interested in the tools that allow us to move in the work plan:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spacebar and left-click: multidirectional movement</li>
            <li>Wheel: vertical movement</li>
            <li>Wheel and [ctrl]: horizontal movement</li>
            <li>Wheel and [alt], or [ctrl]+[+] , [ctrl]+[-] = zoom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you want to display all the plots of your document you can go into View (menu bar) then click on <em>
            Adjust everything to the window</em>.
        </p>

        <h5>Selection</h5>
        <p>
            To select paths, there are two different tools, both accessible from the toolbar:
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image13.jpg">
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image3_en.png">
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image2_en.png">
        <ul>
            <li>1 - The selection tool (black arrow): allows to select the whole of a path</li>
            <li>2 - The direct selection tool (white arrow): allows to select the components of a path, segments, nodes etc..</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The file that you have opened contains a set of linked images in a single group, and you will first dissociate them:
            use the selection tool (black arrow) to select the whole group, then in the Menu go to <em>object</em> and choose
            <em>dissociate</em>. Now each path of the file can be selected and then transformed or moved independently.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image15_en.png">
        <p>
            You will now group all the paths belonging to the different components of the robot,
            first select all the paths that make up the robot's leg: hold down the [shift] key (or [Maj])
            and then with the black arrow select one by one the plots, You can also draw a selection window (click and drag)
            all the objects on which the window will pass will be selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            The active objects are now enclosed in a selection frame: this allows you to transform the selected objects,
            by flying over the frame handles (small squares on the edges of the frame) your cursor will change appearance:
            it will allow you to resize, rotate, and move objects. Holding the [shift] (or [Maj] key) will keep the proportions
            of your selection during transformations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Associate all the paths of the leg: <em>Object> associate</em>
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image23_en.png">
        <p>
            Do the same for all components of the robot:
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image7.jpg">
        <ul>
            <li>1 - The 4 legs (associated one by one)</li>
            <li>2 - The top plate</li>
            <li>3 - The 4 arms (associated one by one)</li>
            <li>4 - The bottom plate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The association of paths between them allows us, among other things, to quickly modify the interdependent objects
            and to keep the alignments during the displacements.
        </p>
        <p>
            By double-clicking on the group of paths you will be able to develop its hierarchy and thus be able to
            modify individually each component of the group.
        </p>
        <p>
            To exit this mode and return to the level of your document just double-click anywhere in your document outside
            your selection, you can also click the gray arrow left.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image10_en.png">
        <p>
            A gray bar appears when editing a group: in this case our leg is called "group" and is on the "Layer 1"
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image18_en.png">
        <p>
            You can find the tree structure of your document in the "layers" panel on the right in the tool panels,
            the main functions of this panel are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1- Develop a hierarchy of a layer (small white arrow) to see objects in it</li>
            <li>2- Show or hide layers (eye icon)</li>
            <li>3- Select the set of objects from the same layer</li>
            <li>4- Create new layers and sublayers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Working with layers makes it easy to organize objects within a document: mainly when we want to group
            identical objects, change their selection color and arrange them between them.
            If, for example, we want an object to be placed in front of another, simply select the corresponding layer
            in the layer pane and then drag it up in the Illustrator tree. Editing a file: in order to guide you
            in the choice of selections you will activate the commented marks, this option helps in determining the objects
            selectable during the mouse over and provides indications that help to draw. To do this go back to <em>view</em>
            (menu bar) and then activate <em>comment marks</em>.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image21_en.png">
        <p>
            We will then activate the rules as well as the grid: <em>View > Show grid</em> then
            <em>View > Rules > Show Rules</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we will modify the work plan: the workplane is our drawing area, it is possible to create several
            of them within the same document. Workbenches can be accessed from the toolbar.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image9.png">
        <p>
            Select the work plan tool in the toolbar: you will see a selection box around your artwork that will allow you
            to modify it and move it.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image17.png">
        <p>
            In the control bar (at the top of your document) set the reference point (1) at the top left, set the work plan (2)
            position to 0 in X and Y and check that its size (3) Make 175mm in X and 175mm in Y.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will now customize the legs of your robot, we will begin by converting the old legs into markers:
            in illustrator any path can be converted into a guide, the guides thus created are aids to the design that exist
            only 'Within Illustrator, they will not appear when exporting the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the selection tool (black arrow) select the 4 legs then click <em>View > Guides > Create Guides</em>.
            The paths you have selected are now marked in light blue.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image4.png">

        <h5>Drawing Tools</h5>
        <p>
            In Illustrator there are many drawing tools, as part of this tutorial we will mainly focus on three different ways
            of creating paths: from simple shapes, with the tool "curve", with the tool "feather".
            We will then see how to combine, deform and change the appearance of the paths we have created.
        </p>

        <h5>Simple shapes</h5>
        <p>
            Let's start by drawing the screw holes of the servomotor. In the toolbar click and hold the left mouse button
            on the rectangle tool, a submenu will appear showing other basic shapes: select the ellipse tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            To draw the ellipse from its center press the [Alt] key on your keyboard, place the pointer in the center
            of the hole guide we created in the previous step. The "center" comment should appear indicating that you are
            hovering over the center of the guide. Click once with the left click, a dialog will open in which you enter
            the dimensions of the circle: 2.1mm X 2.1mm.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image14_en.png">
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image6_en.png">
        <p>
            Repeat for the second screw hole in the leg, then select the rectangle tool to draw the motor housing:
            this time you will click with the left click on the upper left corner of the rectangular guide then hold
            the button And drag to the lower right corner of the rectangle. Release when the "anchor point" comment appears.
        </p>

        <h5>Changing the appearance of paths</h5>
        <p>
            The vector paths have two appearance components: a contour and a fill, both of which can be modified independently
            of each other. It is also possible to create paths with only a contour or only a fill. In our case we do not need
            filling because for the cutting the laser will follow the contours of our paths.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the selection tool (black arrow) select the paths you just created, the appearance of the selected objects
            appears at the top left of the control bar.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image19_en.png">
        <p>
            Hold down the [Shift] key and click Fill. Select the icon with a red diagonal to indicate that there is no fill.
            Always use the [Shift] key, click on outline, to set the maximum value for red (R = 255) and minimum for green and
            blue (G = 0 and B = 0), and then enter <em>0,01mm</em> in the contour thickness.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image8_en.png">
        <p>
            These values define the paths as cut-outs for the laser machine. In the machine control software
            (Trotec Job Control), it is thus possible to parameterize up to 16 different colors which correspond to as many
            different machining strategies.
        </p>

        <h5>Curvature tool</h5>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image014_en.png">
        <p>
            The curvature tool is a way to simply draw curves and straight lines. We will use it to draw the leg of the robot
            on the basis of the guides we have created from the original document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hold down the [alt] key on your keyboard, then place a first point by clicking along the guide,
            and then place a second point along the guide as long as you do not release the [alt] key. Release the [alt] key
            and continue to place points: you now draw curves, a preview of the curve is displayed depending on the position
            of your cursor.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image04.png">
        <p>
            Try to reproduce the original leg as faithfully as possible by following the guides.
            If you want to cancel the last point, press [Ctrl]+[Z], to continue your drawing without taking into account
            the previous curvature press the [alt] key and click on the last point you just created. During the drawing
            you can reposition the points you just placed without changing the tool by simply clicking on them
            and then sliding them to their new position.
        </p>
        <p>
            To finish, close the path by clicking on the first point created: a small circle appears next to your cursor
            indicating that you can close your path. If you want to cancel the operation to restart press [Esc],
            or click the Selection tool in the toolbar (black arrow).
        </p>

        <h5>Editing paths</h5>
        <p>
            The drawing you have created is probably quite approximate to the original model:
            we will now see how to correct the paths. In the toolbar, choose the direct selection tool (white arrow)
            and click on the point you want to modify: you can move it or change its curvature using the two tangent handles.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image8_en.png">
        <p>
            It is also possible to add or remove points on an existing path: use the pen tool located to the left
            of the curvature tool in the toolbar. When browsing a path, a "+" appears next to the cursor indicating
            the possibility of adding points and when an anchor point is over a "-" indicates that you can delete a node.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the pen tool in combination with the direct selection tool to adjust your path to the original model.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pen tool also allows to create traces called "B√©ziers curves", we will see its use in the next step.
        </p>

        <h5>Pen tool</h5>
        <p>
            This tool looks much like the curve tool we have just seen but allows a more precise drawing,
            the curvature of each point is defined during the drawing: for each point placed you have to click
            to create a point and then to drag to define the point Tangent of the curves. To draw straight segments
            just click without moving the mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the same way as above, if you want to continue your path without taking into account the previous curvature,
            click on the last point placed by holding down the [alt] key.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try to draw your own version of the leg using the pen tool: make sure to keep the overall dimensions
            and the position of the servomotor. Use the direct selection tool to correct your path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of customized legs:
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image018.png">
        <p>
            Keep in mind that nothing should obstruct the movement of the robot and that the too thin elements may break.
        </p>
        <p>
            Duplicate your piece in 4 copies by copying and pasting ( [ctrl]+[C] and [ctrl]+[V] )
            or with the black arrow by sliding while holding down the [Alt] key.
        </p>

        <h5>Preparation of paths for laser cutting</h5>
        <p>
            Start by optimizing your document by rearranging the paths between them in order to save the raw material
            as much as possible.
        </p>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image01.png">
        <caption>Original file</caption>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/illustrator/image022.png">
        <caption>Optimized file</caption>
        <p>
            Then select all the paths ( [Ctrl]+[A] or draw a selection box with the selection tool) and make sure
            that the contour thickness is 0.01 mm, that your document is in RGB mode and That the contours
            are in R=255, G=0 and B=0.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally save your document in PDF format by adding your first and last names following the original name. <br>
            <em>File > Save as, type > pdf</em>
        </p>

        <h5>To continue</h5>
        <p>
            The tutorial is now complete: we have presented you the basics of the software,
