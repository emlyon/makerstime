    <h4>Calibration</h4>

    <p>
      The ESP8266 module that you just installed allows you to communicate in wifi with the robot,
      first turn it on and then connect your computer to WiFi at the <em>"Freenove Quadruped Robot"</em> access point.
      The network key is <em>"Freenove"</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Launch the Processing application, open the Sketch <em>"Processing"</em> that you installed at the beginning
      of the tutorial and which can be found in your sketchbook.
    </p>

    <p>
      Turn on the robot and then click <em>"run"</em> and then click <em>"CONNECT"</em> in the new command interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      Select the <em>"CALIBRATION"</em> tab, the robot must move to the calibration position with the 4 legs up.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not have the calibration guide, print it on an A4 sheet without changing its scale: the file is named
      <em>"CalibrationGraph"</em> and is located in the folder you downloaded from the GitHub repository at the very beginning
      of this tutorial. Place the robot on the calibration guide according to its orientation.
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image1.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>Click on <em>"LEG1"</em> and then use the keys [A], [D], [S], [W], [R], and [F] on your keyboard to position the end
      of the tab exactly on the corresponding black dot: [A] moves in +Y, [D] in -Y, [S] in + X, [W] in -X, [R] in + Z and [F]
      in -Z. Repeat for all 4 legs then click <em>"CONFIRM"</em>.
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image14.jpg" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      If you are unable to calibrate your robot, this means that the legs have not been properly mounted: place the robot
      on the back and click on <em>"INSTALLATION"</em>.
    </p>
    <img src="img/assembly/image39.png" style="max-width:100%;">

    <p>
      Carefully unscrew the bottom plate and align each of the tabs individually by unscrewing them and turning them
      one by one according to the diagram above.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this calibration the robot is now ready to take its first steps!
    </p>

    <p>
      It can be controlled in three different ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Either from the processing application with the <em>"CONTROL"</em>, <em>"MOVE BODY"</em> and <em>"ROTATE BODY"</em> tabs</li>
      <li>Using the Android app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freenove.suhayl.Freenove">"Freenove APP"</a></li>
      <li>With the Arduino Remote</li>
    </ul>
