          <p>
              To design the propeller protections, we will use Illustrator (you can download a trial version
              <a href="https://www.adobe.com/fr/products/illustrator/free-trial-download.html" target="_blank">here</a>
              or use it @ makers' lab) and <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" target="_blank">TinkerCAD</a>.<br>
              Next steps will show you how to make a standard propeller protection.<br>
              Keep in mind that you have to make a customisation of your drone and not a standard drone :)

                We will now use the Pathfinder to subtract the square from the white circle.<br>
                The Pathfinder is similar to the "Group" function in Tinkercad as it allows you to perform boolean operator actions.<br>

            <blockquote>
                The Pathfinder is by default right next to "Align" in the Panel.<br>

                In the "Transform" panel, rotate the polygon by 90° then change the W Value to <b>10 mm</b> and the H value to <b>20 mm</b> <br>
                Now align it to the left center of the white semicircle by using "Align to key object", selecting the white semicircle then click on "Vertical Align Center" and in the bottom box enter "-3mm" and finally click on "Horizontal Distribute Space" <br>
                Make sure the semi-white circle and the polygon are highlighted and use the pathfinder to subtract them together.
