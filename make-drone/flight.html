						<h4>Tips for flight</h4>
						<h5><i class="inline-icon material-icons">access_time</i> 1 hour</h5>
						<br>
						<div class="card-action">
								<h5>1. Safety first!</h5>
								<p>
									Always operate your drone in a clear and flat area, 3 to 4 square meters
									should be sufficient for your first flight. Never touch the drone when the propellers are spinning.
									Never fly over a crowded area or a road. Always keep your drone in sight and fly it only at day,
									donâ€™t fly over private properties. Remember that you are responsible of your drone and any damage you may cause using it.
								</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card-action">
								<h5>2. Know your drone </h5>
								<p>
									Where is the front? There is 3 ways to determine the orientation of your drone :
								  small arrow on the controller board, color of the bumpers, and the 3 LEDs on the bottom of pcb
									(1 blue on the front and 2 greens on the back).
								</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card-action">
								<h5>3. Throttle, Yaw, Pitch an Roll</h5>
								<p>
										These are the main movements you can use to navigate in the air.
								</p>
								<blockquote>
										Throttle : vertical up and down. <br>

										Pitch : forward and backward tilt. <br>

										Roll : side to side tilt. <br>

								</blockquote>
								<br>
						</div>
						<div class="card-action">
								<h5>4. Remote</h5>
								<p>
										Left joystick is for throttle (up and down) and yaw (left and right),
										right joystick is for pitch (up and down) and roll (left and right).
										The buttons 1 to 8 are used to adjust the center position of corresponding direction of joystick, if needed you
										can use the D button to reset the centers of joysticks to their default position.
										Switch A is for arming the motors, B, C switches are additionals channels and will not be used here.
								</p>

						</div>
						<div class="card-action">
								<h5>5. Ready to start</h5>
								<p>
										Put the throttle jog down (left joystick) and power on the remote.
								<blockquote>

								</blockquote>
								<br>
								<p>
										Plug the battery on the drone and place it on the ground in a flat and clear area
										with the back towards you and press the power button. The "signal" LEDs should flash
										simultaneously on both drone and remote.
							 	</p>
								<blockquote>

								<p>
										Pull the A swtich on the remote to arm the motors.

								<br>
								<p>
									The Green LEDs on the bottom of the drone should starts flashing,
									If the LEDs doesn't lit toggle the A switch on the remote another time.

									<h5>6. First flight</h5>
									<p>
											Try to stabilize your drone at 50cm from the ground : gently pull the left joystick up
											until propellers starts to spin and the drone slowly takes off. Observe the drone behavior
											and try to stabilize it using the right joystick.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										Throttle up gently. <br>

									<br>
									<p>
											Be careful not to go too high or too fast and prepare yourself to land
											before the drone hits something or someone.

										<h5>7. Practice</h5>
										<p>
												Flying drones is not easy, you will have to practice :
												begin by small flights to get used to the behavior of the drone and
												try the different movements - throttle, Yaw, Pitch and roll - individually.
												Progressively increase fly duration by trying to move the drone around you
												in a restrained area.
